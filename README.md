## How to Contribute

Striving for a more accessible website not only creates a clean work environment and readibilty, but it allows access for a broader user base. Inclusion is important, especially on the web. Contribute by keeping an open mind on who may use your work. Everyone deserves to enjoy the web, code then to!
